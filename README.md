Stegano: Secret Encoder is a project I developed to explore the field of steganography and secure data handling. This project focuses on the intriguing domain of steganography, which involves concealing secret information within seemingly innocuous forms such as images, audio files, or text.

The main objective of Stegano: Secret Encoder is to provide a reliable and secure method for hiding confidential data within different types of media files. By leveraging pixel-level manipulation in image files, audio sample modifications, or subtle adjustments in text files, the project ensures that the embedded information remains intact and undetectable.

One of the key aspects of this project is its user-friendly interface, which allows users to easily select the carrier file and the secret data to be embedded. The application handles the encoding process automatically, and the resulting output file appears identical to the original, preventing suspicion.

To ensure the security and integrity of the hidden data, the project also employs encryption techniques before embedding the secret information. This adds an extra layer of protection against unauthorized access.

The significance of Stegano: Secret Encoder lies in its potential applications, including secure communication, covert information storage, and privacy protection. Working on this project helped me gain a deeper understanding of data security, cryptography, and the art of hiding information in plain sight.

This project reflects my passion for exploring innovative technologies and applying them to real-world challenges as I continue growing in the field of software engineering.
